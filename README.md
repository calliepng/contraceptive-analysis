# contraceptive-analysis
An investigation of data modeling methods to predict Indonesian women’s contraceptive usage in 1987

# Overview

The Contraceptive Method Choice Dataset ("contraceptive.csv") compiles data collected from the 1987 National
Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. Information on the 1473 women includes their choice of
contraception of either no usage, short-term methods or long-term alternatives, as well as socio-economic
and demographic attributes such as education level, working status and standard of living. This report
investigates data modeling methods to predict a woman’s contraceptive usage based on socio-economic
attributes.

# Question of interest

The study is interested in the impact of a woman’s education on her choice of family planning devices, or, in other terms, how accurately we can predict a woman’s choice of contraceptive between no-use, long-term and short-term, based
on her education level.
